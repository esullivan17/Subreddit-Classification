# Subreddit-Classification
In this project, files were loaded from kaggle. There were two training sets and two test sets; for each category one contained reddit comments as text, the other contained the numerical embeddings of a reddit comment. The goal was to determine what subreddit the comment originated from using principal component analysis and a xgboost model.
